# Slackware-1.01    
The floppy disks of the first slackware linux distro    
    
What i did:    
* Looked at (https://mirrors.slackware.com/slackware/slackware-1.01/)    
* Downloaded each file in each folder (a2-a13) and a1disk from a1 folder    
* Created 13 floppys, formatted each one of them in a virtualbox WindowsXP guest    
* Shared the folder containing (a2-a13) to the WindowsXP and transfering files    
    
And followed this video exactly https://youtu.be/Z8VVNiBwZI0    

I wasted my time on those steps so don't waste yours :)  
    
ONE THING I CHANGED:    
a10 folder was 2MB and floppy is only 1.4MB so i removed one package which was marked as optional
