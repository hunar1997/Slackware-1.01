# Slackware-1.01
The floppy disks of the first slackware linux distro

What i did:
Lookd at (https://mirrors.slackware.com/slackware/slackware-1.01/)
Downloaded each file in each folder (a2-a13) and a1disk from a1 folder
Created 13 floppys, formatted each one of them in a virtualbox WindowsXP guest
Shared the folder containing (a2-a13) to the WindowsXP and transfering files

and followed this video exactly https://youtu.be/Z8VVNiBwZI0
but at the end my kernel panics and doesn't know how to load root (whatever that is suppose to mean)
if your's worked i'm very happy

I wasted my time, don't waste yours

ONE THING I CHANGED:
a10 folder was 2MB and floppy is only 1.4MB so i removed one package which was marked as optional
